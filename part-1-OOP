C# Track - Part 1 - OOP with Legos

Watch the Instructional videos at the following link to learn about the 4 main OOP concepts. After
watching please create a google doc and in your own words describe each of the 4 concepts in 3 sentences
or less! (the less you need to define it the better)

1 Inheritance
2 Polymorphism
3 Encapsulation
4 Abstraction

Inheritance:
Inheritance is one of the important feature of OOP. Inheritance is the ability to create a derived
class (child) that inherits the attributes and behaviours of the base class (parent class).

Polymorphism:
Polymorphism is ability to process objects differently depending on their data type or class. It
is often expressed as ‘One interface, multiple functions’.

Encapsulation:
Encapsulation is a mechanism to encapsulate or hide the unwanted code or behavior from the user.
Encapsulation enables a group of properties, methods and other members to be considered a single unit
or object. Class is the best example of encapsulation.

Abstraction:
Abstraction in C# is used to show only the essential behavior of an object. In case of abstraction
we know how an object can be used but do not know how it is implemented.
